You're on the phone with your girlfriend
She's upset, she's going off about something that you said
Cause she doesnt get your humor like I do
I'm in the room it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do
But she wears short skirts, I wear t-shirts
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me
You belong with me
Walk in the streets with you in your worn out jeans
I cant help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on the park bench thinking to myself,
hey isn't this easy
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine I know you better than that
Hey what you doing with a girl like that
She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me
Standing by waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know baby
You belong with me
You belong with me
Oh I remember you driving to
my house in the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
when you know you're about to cry
I know your favorite songs and you tell me about your dreams
I think I know where you belong. I think I know it's with me
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me
Standing by waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know baby
You belong with me
You belong with me
You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me
You belong with me
